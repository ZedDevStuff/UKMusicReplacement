# UKMusicReplacement

Ultrakill mod allowing users to use custom songs in regular (non boss or special) levels

# Installation

To install, just unzip the release in your BepInEx plugins folder (or "UKMM Mods" if you use UKMM). Requires [UKUIHelper](https://github.com/ZedDevStuff/UKUIHelper) to work.

# How to add custom songs

To add custom songs, open "CustomMusic" in the mod folder, create a folder named with the number of the level you want to replace the music from (ie "4-1","1-2", nothing more, nothing less) and add your 2 songs, one must be named "clean" and the other "battle". They must be either an ogg, wav or mp3 file.
